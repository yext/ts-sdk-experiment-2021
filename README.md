# Experimental code â€” not for production use!

This repository contains some work-in-progress experiments for
generating a TypeScript SDK for the Yext API. It has been published for
Yext-internal use only.

**This code is completely unsupported; its interfaces will definitely
change; and this repository will likely disappear at some point in the
future.**
