/**
 * Contains the daily pickup hours, holiday pickup hours, and reopen date for the Entity.
 * 
 * Each day is represented by a sub-field of `pickupHours`. (e.g. `monday`, `tuesday`, etc.) Open times can be specified per day through the `openIntervals` field and the `isClosed` flag.
 * Similarly, holiday pickup hours are represented by the `holidayHours` sub-field.
 * Setting the `reopenDate` sub-field indicates that the business is temporarily closed and will reopen on the specified date.
 * SPECIAL CASES:
 * * To indicate that an Entity is open 24 hours on a specific day, set start to 00:00 and end to 23:59 in `openIntervals` for that day.
 * * To indicate that an Entity has split hours on specific day (e.g., open from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and again from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM), supply up to two `openIntervals` values with non-overlapping sets of hours.
 * * If you are providing `openIntervals`, you may not set `isClosed` to true for that day.
